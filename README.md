# psi-LiNGAM
The code is based on the BiLiNGAM method we proposed. It is a combination of the Bayesian incorporating psi-learning method and the direct LiNGAM method. 
Some prior packages/toolbox you need before running the code: R packages equSA (for psi-learning) and huge (for nonparanomal transformation) and Matlab code at https://sites.google.com/site/sshimizu06/lingam.
We give an example of the simulation study.
